/*
JavaScript has 7 primitive data types:
String: Represents textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., "hello", 'world').
Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers (e.g., 10, 3.14).
BigInt: Represents integers of arbitrary precision, useful for very large numbers.
Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. 
Symbol: Represents unique and immutable values, often used as object keys. 
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

 Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. When you perform operations on a primitive value, you are creating a new value rather than modifying the original one.
